# Modeling-bacterial-interactions

Code availability
-------
The codes for the following methods can be found in the Modeling-bacterial-interactions/code directory:

- **DADA2**: R scripts for processing 16S rRNA gene sequences.

- **Memote**: Models were converted from xls format to sbml format for memote analysis.

- **pFBA**: Parsimonious flux balance analysis. Simulate the growth of model combinations and find the exchange fluxes.

- **dFBA**: Dynamic flux balance analysis. Simulate interaction states and growth conditions of multiple strains.


  Each subfolder contains a README file detailing how to reproduce the data analysis using the appropriate code.				
  
  For more details, please download the file and locate the required file in the corresponding subfolder.

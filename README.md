# Modeling-bacterial-interactions

Code availability
-------
The codes for DADA2, Memote, pFBA and dFBA can be found in the `Modeling-bacterial-interactions/code` directory

- **DADA2**: R scripts for processing 16S rRNA gene sequences.

- **Memote**: Models were converted from xls format to sbml format for memote analysis.

- **pFBA**: Parsimonious flux balance analysis. Simulate the growth of model combinations and find the exchange fluxes.

- **dFBA**: Dynamic flux balance analysis. Simulate interaction states and growth conditions of multiple strains.


  Each subfolder contains a README file detailing how to reproduce the data analysis using the appropriate code.				
  

Data availability
-------

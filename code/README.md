# code

- **DADA2**：Bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis. The end product is an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table.

- **Memote**：Evaluate the quality of models by the metabolic model testing suite (MEMOTE).

- **pFBA**：Parsimonious flux balance analysis. Simulate the growth of the combinations of models, and find exchange fluxes based on the combination.

- **dFBA**：Dynamic flux balance analysis. Focuses on metabolic network modelling and optimisation, simulating interaction states and growth conditions of multiple strains.


Each directory contains a README file detailing how to reproduce the data analysis using the appropriate code.

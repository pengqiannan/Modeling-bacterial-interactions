# code

- **DADA2**: R scripts for processing 16S rRNA gene sequences.

- **Memote**: Evaluate the quality of models by the metabolic model testing suite (MEMOTE).

- **pFBA**: Parsimonious flux balance analysis. Simulate the growth of model combinations and find the exchange fluxes.

- **dFBA**: Dynamic flux balance analysis. Simulate interaction states and growth conditions of multiple strains.

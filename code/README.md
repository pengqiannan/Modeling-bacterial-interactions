# code

- **DADA2**: R scripts for processing 16S rRNA gene sequences.

- **Memote**: Evaluate the quality of models by the metabolic model testing suite (MEMOTE).

- **pFBA**: Parsimonious flux balance analysis. Simulate the growth of the combinations of models, and find exchange fluxes based on the combination.

- **dFBA**: Dynamic flux balance analysis. Simulating interaction states and growth conditions of multiple strains.




  Each directory contains a README file detailing how to reproduce the data analysis using the appropriate code.
